## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Workit Landing Page](https://workit-jet.vercel.app/)

### Built with

- HTML5
- Custom CSS properties
- Mobile-first approach
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

### What I learned

Completing this project taught me the importance and efficiency of a mobile-first approach. I started with a desk-top first approach and found it tedious to go back and re-adjust elements for smaller screen sizes versus starting with mobile designs and building up.

### Continued development

I would adopt and implement this layout for a my pet project's landing page

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap Docs](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Reading through the Bootstrap documentation when I got stuck really helped me learn more about responsive layouts, specifically how to utilize their rows and columns, so I didn't have to rely on vanilla CSS for flexbox and grid.
